      <strong>1. Summary of the project objectives<br></strong>
   	In this report we summarize the research activity performed by 
	Dr. Emidio Capriotti during the outgoing phase of the Marie-Curie 
	IOF at the Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University under
	the supervision of Dr. Russ B. Altman.<br>
	The main aims of our proposal are the following: <br><br>
	i. Study and characterization of the rate of evolution of Single 
	Nucleotide 	Polymorphisms and their effect in human disease.<br>
	ii. Study and characterization of the structural determinants of 
	human disease.<br>
	iii. Development of new general machine learning methods for disease 
	prediction.<br>
	iv. Development of disease-specific predictors. <br>
	v. Development of a World Wide Web server for predicting the likelihood 
	of a SNP variant to be associated with human disease.<br><br>
	These 5 aims correspond to 6 different tasks that have to be 
	accomplished in 36 	months. In the proposal's timeline, we planned 
	to perform about 4 over the 6 tasks during the outgoing phase (24 months).
	According to this, we mainly achieved the first 3 objectives and part 
	of the 4th and 5th. The remaining parts of specific aims 4 and 5 will 
	be performed during the returning phase at the University of Balearic 
	Islands (Spain).<br><br>
	  <strong>2. Description of the work performed since the beginning of the 	
	  project</strong><br>
	During the first months of the project Dr. Emidio Capriotti selected a 
	set of annotated missense Single Nucleotide Variants (mSNVs) from the 
	database SwissVar. The dataset used in this work has been downloaded at the 
	end of October 2009. The selection of the subset of mSNVs for which the
	three-dimensional structure of the proteins is known, EC implemented programs 
	able to automatically compare the sequences of the mutated proteins with 
	the sequences of the protein collected in the Protein Data Bank (PDB).
	In a second phase EC performed a evolutionary analysis calculating the 
	selective pressure acting at codon level using alignments between the human 
	DNA sequences and their homolog in mammalian species. In the next 
	steps Dr. Capriotti built a machine-learning base approaches to predict 
	the impact of mSNVs evaluating the discriminative power of different 
	features. In these algorithms we included features from sequence analysis 
	such as evolutionary and functional information and protein structure 
	information. In last period a disease-specific method have been 
	developed to predict the cancer causing mSNVs. <br><br>
	  <strong>3. Description of the achieved results</strong><br>
	With the research activity performed during the outgoing phase, EC reached 
	the largest part of the objectives described in our proposal. In particular, 
	we defined a set of discriminative features derived from protein sequence 
	profile and protein structure. 
	This allowed to 
	develop a new machine learning based method for the prediction of deleterious
	variant taking in input information from protein sequence profile, protein
	function and protein structure. The improvement of the prediction accuracy
	resulting from the use of structure information has been quantitatively 
	estimated comparing the structure-based method with similar sequence-based 
	tool.<br><br>
	  <strong>4. Expected final results and their potential impact</strong><br>
	After the returning phase we expect to have developed a user-friendly web 
	server interface for the prediction of the effect of mSNVs. Currently, 
	EC is implementing these web tools including both protein sequence and 
	structure information. We believe that the use of structural information 
	in the prediction of deleterious variants will be important for the 
	understanding of the disease mechanism. In addition the developed method 
	will have an impact in personal genomics allowing to make new hypothesis
	about the insurgence of genetic diseases. As natural consequence of this work we 	are planning to study the relationship between genetic variants and drug 
	response. The application of newly developed tools in clinical settings 
	will be important for the establishment of personalized medicine.<br><br>

      <tbody><tr><td valign=top>
        During the first two years of the outgoing phase the first three aims 
        of the project have been accomplished. These objectives correspond 
        to the first four tasks. In details after collecting a set of
        manually curated human variants, we analyzed them considering different
        evolutive information obtained aligning the protein sequence with a set
        of related proteins in other species. In the second period, we selected 
        a subset of mutations for which structural information are available. 
        Analyzing these mutations we identifying important feature to improve 
        the prediction of deleterious variants. To accomplish the 3rd aim of 
        the project, we developed different general machine learning-based 
        approaches to discriminate between disease-related and neutral variants. 
        After a testing procedure we have shown that protein structure features 
        increase the quality of the prediction and provide information about the 
        mechanism of the disease. During the last months EC started to collect a 
        manually curated dataset of mutations related to cancer and characterize 
        them from the functional point of view. In the next period, EC is planning 
        to develop a disease-specific method for the prediction of cancer causing
        variants using sequence information. For more details about the 
        performed activity during the outgoing phase please refer to the next 
        section.

      <tbody><tr><td valign=top>
      <strong>1. Progress towards objectives and details for each task</strong><br>
	In this section we summarized the objectives achieved for each one
	of the five aims described in our proposal during the outgoing phase 
	at the Stanford University.<br><br>
	1.1 Study and characterization of the rate of evolution of Single Nucleotide 
	Polymorphisms and their effect in human disease.<br>
	To achieve the first objective of our proposal Dr Capriotti did two different 
	type of analysis. The evolution of the protein in the mutated position was 
	studied considering both alignments of similar protein sequences or DNA 
	alignment between homolog genes. Using different features, these data confirm 
	the idea the wild-type residues are more conserved in disease-related sites 
	than neutral and the mutated residues appear more frequently in the positions of
	the multiple sequence alignment corresponding to neutral mutation with respect 
	to those disease-related.<br><br>
	1.2 Study and characterization of the structural determinants of human
	disease.<br>
	After the characterization of mSNVs in terms conservation and evolution 
	across species, we analyzed structural features of mutated residues. In
	this direction the first goal has been the development of an automatic 
	method to map the mSNVm for protein sequence to structure. The protein 
	structures and the mutated sites in the selected dataset have been analyzed 
	to find new discriminative features. First we calculated the distributions
	of the relative solvent accessible area (RASA) for disease-related and neutral
	mSNVs and the occurrences in each secondary structural class. The results show 
	a significant difference between the distributions of RASA for disease-related 
	and neutral variants. More in details the disease-related mutations are more 
	likely to happen in the core of the proteins and neutral ones on the 
	surface.<br><br>
	1.3 Development of new general machine learning methods for disease 
	prediction.<br>
	EC developed a sequence-based method. This algorithm is a Support Vector 
	Machine trained on data extracted from protein sequence, profile, the output 
	of PANTHER and a functional score derived using Gene Ontology terms of the 
	protein under mutations and all their parents. The sequence-based SVM takes 
	in input a 51 elements vector and a second SVM base method has been developed
	including structural information. Thus the sequence-base algorithm has been 
	used as baseline to quantify the improvement of the prediction resulting from 
	the use of structural information. <br><br>
	1.4 Development of disease-specific predictors<br>
	For this particular task EC is focusing on the detection of mutations involved 
	in the insurgence of different types of cancers. Thus a set of manually 
	curated driver variants associated to cancer has been selected.<br><br>
	<strong>2. Researcher training activities/transfer of knowledge 
	activities/integration activities</strong><br>
	In the period of the outgoing phase at Stanford University, EC was appointed 
	as postdoc in the Department of Bioengineering. He had the opportunity to 
	attend different courses. In addition he cooperated for specific projects with 
	the researcher at the PharmGKB consortium that is interested to analyze the 
	effect of genetic variants on drug response.<br><br>
	<strong>3. Highlight significant results</strong><br>
	During the first phase, EC achieved many significant results related to the 
	main objectives of the Mut2Dis project. First of all, EC analyzed large dataset 
	of annotated mutations evaluating evolutionary and structural information. 
	More practical results is the development of a new machine learning base 
	approach based on protein structure information to predict the effect of 
	missense single nucleotide variants.<br><br>
	<strong>4.	Statement on the use of resources</strong><br>
	For the development of this project during the last two years the University of 
	Balearic Island had total expenses for 156.475,14 € (see table in the attached file). 
	In the Form C attached to this report we included only the amount provided by the 
	European Community (Total 152,627.84 €).<br><br>

        During the outgoing period EC dedicated part of the time to disseminate 
        the results of this project in international conferences, workshops 
        and in invited seminars in institutions both in US and Europe.To 
        summarize the dissemination activity performed in the last two years, EC
        published one paper about the results obtained in this study 
        <a href="documents/papers/Capriotti_AIMM_BMCBioinformatics2011.pdf" target=blank>(Capriotti 
        and Altman, BMC Bioinformatics, 2011)</a> and one review

        submitted 10 posters to meetings and conferences, 6 of which have been
        selected for oral presentation. Finally EC was invited to give 12 
        seminars where he presented the results of the Mut2Dis research project. 
        EC is also maintaining web page were details of there project are made 
        available. In the returning phase, EC is planning to attend important 
        meetings and conferences to advertise the web server for the prediction 
        of deleterious variants that will be developed during the next year. In
        addition other papers and review are in preparation and we believe that 
        will be published during the second phase.<br><br>
